description: Aligning the business objectives and design thinking with a human-centric mindset drives my design process. Aiming to achieve and maintain design consistency across all product touchpoints, and taking responsibility for the decisions in the process, my goal is to deliver high quality standard of results, prioritizing user-centeric design over showcase of aesthetics.
