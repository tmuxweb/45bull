ðŸ‘‹ Tom here, I appreciate your interest in learning more about my background. 

For the last couple of years, all of my focus has been directed towards partnering with digital health startups. After collaborating with a couple of exceptional teams in this field, my decision has been made to seek out similar opportunities and center my efforts on digital products that positively affects the lives and wellbeing of others.

Prior to this, I've been involved in a diverse range of projects during my career as a designer, covering fields such as telematics, data, web3, IoT, digital marketing etc., each with their own unique rules, customs and practices. I've gained valuable insights into numerous product development cycles, as well as user and business goals, and learned how to give and solicit feedback without being overly attached to my work when constructive feedback is put forward.

I consider myself detail-oriented, pragmatic and collaborative. Over the years, I've held both project-based and full-time roles in various remote teams, and I consider myself very diligent and disciplined when it comes to distributed teamwork. My professional proficiency in verbal and written English allows me to have fluent conversations when ideas have to be pitched or communicated efficiently and succinctly.
