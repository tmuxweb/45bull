> I help digital health startups to eliminate user retention issues and improve the user experience of their products. 

The core focus of my work is to **craft frictionless, intuitive and accessible experiences** for web, native and hybrid applications in digital health. The concept itself may sound simple on the face of it, but achieving it necessitates structured line of action and proper planning.

Each project is approached objectively and without bias, from an impartial and neutral perspective, allowing for a prompt and clear understanding of the product's friction points, as well as the tacit and latent user needs related to it. 

There are three core types of services that I provide, and despite being highlighted separately, all of them are interdependent as a result of their natural overlap. Based on the specifics of your project, each of the three can be either combined, or delivered as a standalone service.

## ðŸ§­ Consult
Each product holds the potential for further improvement, and such opportunities are uncovered by gaining a comprehensive understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. We can collaborate to analyze your product's objectives, identify and troubleshoot user experience issues, help uncover unfulfilled user needs and provide ongoing directions to your team.

## ðŸŽ¯ Audit
Digital products, irrespective of their category or type, often emerge with various repetitive patterns of friction. Drawing from my past experiences and knowledge of interface design, UX and HCI, my audits can help uncover such issues, whether obvious or concealed, and devise well-rounded, improved solutions through iteration and testing.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design
Aligning the business objectives and design thinking with a human-centric mindset drives my design process. Aiming to achieve and maintain design consistency across all product touchpoints, and taking responsibility for the decisions in the process, my goal is to deliver high quality standard of results, prioritizing user-centeric design over showcase of aesthetics.

# Why focus solely on digital health?

The idea to pursue only digital health opportunities came naturally, right after I partnered with a German eHealth startup in 2018. Soon I was made aware how such projects are not only technically engaging, but also have tangible, meaningful impact on people's lives and wellbeing.

The promising trends of this field gave me the additional confidence for such decision as well. As the healthcare services go through significant transformations in all of its areas of practice across the world, global demands for those services are continually on the rise. Governments across the world are backing various digital transformation initiatives, further driving up the adoption of the digital health market, which is on pace to grow from US$170B to US$300B in global annual revenue by 2028.

With the growing demand for healthcare services, there is a corresponding increase in the number of individuals actively involved in managing their conditions, fostering innovative care models and progessively shifting towards more integrated and personalized healthcare systems. 

Digital transformation has enabled individuals to access healthcare services beyond traditional medical settings, and I firmly believe that now is the right moment to develop winning products that will have permanence and give healthcare providers and recipients personalized and accessible experiences.

Moreover, there is also a personal rationale behind my decision to center on one specific niche, stemming from Jenny Holzer's truism featured on a BMW V12 LMR Art Car;<br>
